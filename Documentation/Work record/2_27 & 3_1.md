## Things done
- **Implemented the entrying detection function**
  - The data read by ToF sensor is a 25 x 20 matrix. 
  - This funciton will monitor the first 5 rows of matrix(The 1st row is the door side)
  - The range from sensor to floor is ~3100, the range from the highest point of door to the sensor is ~1400, the range from desk to the sensor is ~2400
  - Once there is a data read from this rows below 2500, the function will start to detect any movement in the area of remaining pixels. 
  - If more than 5 pixels in the remaining area detected movement, the function returns a "lights on" command to the server to turn on the lights.

## Next step
- **The function will turn on the lights when someone is entering and leaving the room** 
  - This problem is caused by monitoring the data of the first 5 rows. To be specific, when the door stays open, thedata returned from these rows will always be lower than 2500. (The range from door to snesor is ~1400) Thus, the function will continuely entering the "1 second movement detecting" part. In other words, when the door stays open, any movement under the sensor will be considered as an entry signal. 
  - One possible solution is to detect the data change of the first 5 rows instead of just comparing the value of data with threshold of 2500.
